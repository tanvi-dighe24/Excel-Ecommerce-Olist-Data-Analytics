# Olist E-commerce Analytics Project (Excel)

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of the Olist Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset, utilizing Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. The objective is to extract actionable insights from customer orders, product information, seller details, and other related data to understand key business performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.

## Project Overview

The Olist dataset, encompassing orders from 2016 to 2018, provides a rich source of information for e-commerce analysis. This project focuses on leveraging Excel's capabilities to:

- **Clean and preprocess raw data**: Address missing values, inconsistencies, and data type issues across multiple linked datasets.
- **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in sales, customer behavior, product performance, and logistical efficiency.
- **Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs)**: Track metrics such as total sales, average order value, customer lifetime value (CLTV), order frequency, and delivery performance.
- **Visualize data insights**: Create insightful charts, pivot tables, and dashboards within Excel to present findings clearly and effectively.
- **Generate business recommendations**: Provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing operational efficiency.

## Key Areas of Analysis

- **Sales Performance**: Analyze sales trends over time, identify top-selling products and categories, and understand revenue distribution by region.
- **Customer Analysis**: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior (e.g., using RFM analysis), identify high-value customers, and analyze customer satisfaction through review scores.
- **Product Analysis**: Evaluate product performance, identify popular product categories, and analyze pricing strategies.
- **Seller Performance**: Assess seller performance based on sales volume, delivery times, and customer reviews.
- **Logistics and Delivery**: Analyze delivery times, identify potential bottlenecks, and evaluate the impact of logistics on customer satisfaction.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: For all data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
